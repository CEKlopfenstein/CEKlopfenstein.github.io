And we felt we had made quite reasonable progress. Following are a few interesting tables and demo images of the final product. Along with a few links we should have probably added to our final documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;test-cases&quot;&gt;Test Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a table of test cases used to ensure that the app operated as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Test ID&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Test Case&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Precondition&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Test Steps&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Expected Results&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Log in using a valid Gmail Account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;A valid Gmail Account&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Open the App.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select &quot;Login Using Google.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select or Enter a valid Gmail account as prompted.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Successful login is indicated by the app moving to display the list of semesters as well as an updated data within Firebase for the last time the user has logged on.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Log out of the app.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Open the app.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the &quot;Hamburger&quot; menu in the upper right of the list of semeters screen.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select &quot;Log Out&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The account will be successfully logged out. With the indication being that the app now only displays the login screen. And allows for a new login.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Add a Semester&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Open the app.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the &quot;+&quot; button on the lower right of the list of semesters screen.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Enter a Semester Name and Select OK.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Once a semester is added it should appear within the list of semesters in the app. As well as appear within Firebase under the specific user that is logged in. If a semester of the entered name already exists the user should be prompted to try again.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-4&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Open a Semester.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-3&quot;&gt;test 3&lt;/a&gt;. Or the successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 3&lt;/a&gt; with an already populated account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Open the app.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select a semeter from the list displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The app should open to a list of classes within that Semester. Displaying class names. With the list being based on the contents of Firebase for the corresponding semester, and user.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-5&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Add a Class.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-4&quot;&gt;test 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Perform the actions of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-4&quot;&gt;test 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the &quot;+&quot; button on the lower right of the display.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Enter the class name and select OK.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Once a class is added it should appear in the list seen in the app for the currently opened semester. As well as appear within Firebase and be associated with the correct semester and user. If a class of that name already exists within the semester the user will be prompted to try again.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-6&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Open a Class.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-5&quot;&gt;test 5&lt;/a&gt;. Or the successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt; with an already populated account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Perform the actions of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-4&quot;&gt;test 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select a class from the list.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The app should open to a list of students within that class. Displaying student names and the number of times they have been checked in. With the list being based on the contents of Firebase for the corresponding class, semester, and user.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-7&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Add a student.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-6&quot;&gt;test 6&lt;/a&gt;. Or the successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt; with an already populated account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Perform the actions of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-6&quot;&gt;test 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the &quot;+&quot; button on the lower right.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Enter the student's name and email.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select OK.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Once a student is added they should appear in the list seen in the app for the currently opened class. As well as appear within Firebase and be associated with the correct class, semester, and user. If a student with the same information already exists within the class nothing will change and the student's information will remain unchanged.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Import a Class List.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;A valid CSV file formatted in the aggreed upon method and the successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-6&quot;&gt;test 6&lt;/a&gt;. Or the successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt; with an already populated account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Perform the actions of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-6&quot;&gt;test 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the Import button.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Find the CSV file.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the CSV file.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Each student found within the CSV file should be added and appear in the list seen in the app for the currently opened class. As well as appears within Firebase and be associated with the correct class, semester, and user. If a student with the same information already exists within a class nothing will change and the student's information will remain unchanged. A message should also appear saying how many students where added successfully.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-9&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Email QR Codes.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-7&quot;&gt;test 7&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-8&quot;&gt;test 8&lt;/a&gt;. Or the completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt; with an already populated account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Perform the actions of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-6&quot;&gt;test 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the &quot;Send QR Codes&quot; button.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Each Student within the class should then be sent an email containing a QR code and the instructions on what to do with it. As well as an explanation as to why they are receiving the email and for which class.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-10&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Scan QR Codes.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Valid QR Codes. Along with the successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-7&quot;&gt;test 7&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-8&quot;&gt;test 8&lt;/a&gt;. Or the completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt; with an already populated account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Perform the actions of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-6&quot;&gt;test 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the &quot;Scan QR&quot; button.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Place the QR codes in front of the camera for scanning.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Press the Android Back button to finalize scanning session.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;After scanning each QR code a message should pop on the screen indicating if the code was scanned and if it was valid. If it was a valid code Firebase will be updated accordingly with the presence being marked in the student's attendance record for that class. And within the app, the list of students in the class will display a new number of how many times the student has been marked as present.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-11&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Manually mark a Student as present.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-7&quot;&gt;test 7&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-8&quot;&gt;test 8&lt;/a&gt;. Or the completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt; with an already populated account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Perform the actions of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-6&quot;&gt;test 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select a student from the list.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Within the student details select the &quot;Mark as present&quot; button.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The attendance record of the student selected should update accordingly on Firebase. As well as the attendance counter displayed within the list of students.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=&quot;test-case-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Export a Class's attendance record.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The successful completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-7&quot;&gt;test 7&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-8&quot;&gt;test 8&lt;/a&gt;. Or the completion of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-1&quot;&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt; with an already populated account.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Perform the actions of &lt;a href=&quot;#test-case-6&quot;&gt;test 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the export to CSV option.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Select the location of where to save the export.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Keep the same name or rename the export as desired.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Click &quot;Save&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;A CSV file containing the names of all the students in the selected class and their attendance records should be generated. Containing the total number of times the student attended class and the dates they checked in.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools-and-links&quot;&gt;Tools and Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the project we ended up using a few different tools and links. Following are a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;database-firebase&quot;&gt;Database (Firebase)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall with this project I think we where all pleased with the End result. With our final live demonstration being a massive success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prove that everything was functioning as it should. We compiled a CSV file containing the names and email addresses of each of our classmates as well as the professor. So when demonstrating importing functionality we imported that list. With the demonstration of the Email functionality using the same list. The intention being that when we hit the button students in the audience would see that it was functioning as well as the professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even got a chuckle out of the professor. Though even with that success there are a few things I’d change. For example while you can mark a student as present. You can not revert this. So if a student was erroneously marked as present the only method of changing it would be to delete the student’s record. But it’s all little things like that. Where given more time we could iron out the bugs. But unfortunately we only had a semester. It was a fun project never the less with most of the major functionality working quite well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="attendance-tracker" /><summary type="html">After a semester of work our teams final presentation was May 6th.

Along with a requirements glossary which would be carried over to nearly all of our follow up documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page actually contains less information than our original Software Requirements document contained. With the reason behind that being that I did not want this page to be a complete copy paste from the original document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images that contain identifiable information are also redacted. Though the student names will not be as they where random names used for display purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements-glossary&quot;&gt;Requirements Glossary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our requirements glossary was relatively simple. And while it likely could have been expanded it defined everything that we felt could be in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Word/Terminology&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Definition&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;QR Code&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;A graphical encoding of information that is machine-readable similar to a barcode and can be scanned with a camera.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;OAuth&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;An open standard that is used to allow users to give other sites access to certain information without using a username and password. Can be used for account creation as well as sign-in. Examples of this include the sign-in with Google feature seen on many websites&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;CSV File&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;A kind of text file that contains values separated with commas and new line characters. Can be opened and edited as a text file with many spreadsheet applications also providing the ability to edit them in a table format&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-requirements&quot;&gt;User Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the final requirements our team met with the client as well as went over the document provided by the previous team. And in doing so it was determined we had the following requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-authentication&quot;&gt;User Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requirement was specifically requested by the client. And will allow the professor’s information to be stored to an online account in a database. And in doing so it would allow allow the client and future professors using the app to use the app and the same records across multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-and-viewing-semesters&quot;&gt;Creating and Viewing Semesters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also determined that to better organize the classes that a professor might host we would need to provide a method of dividing the classes into different semesters. Allowing “duplicate” classes to exist in different semesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-viewing-and-interacting-with-classes&quot;&gt;Creating, Viewing, and Interacting with Classes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pivotal part of the project through was that a professor will need to be able to create, view, and interacting with classes. Which will contain a list of students. This requirement also requires the professor to be able to import student lists. As well as export student attendance records. Then allowing the professor to email the QR codes to students. While also allowing students within a class to be marked as present manually if the QR code scanning fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counting-students-for-attendance&quot;&gt;Counting Students for Attendance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During normal operation though students should be able to scan the QR codes they received in their email to mark themselves as present. While also providing an error output to notify the student haven’t been marked as present. So they can either try again or be manually marked by the professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exporting-attendance-and-attendance-reports&quot;&gt;Exporting Attendance and Attendance Reports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professor will also need to be able to view the attendance records of the students within a class. As well as export it in the form of a CSV. Allowing them to transfer that information into other programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-cases&quot;&gt;User Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also determined the following use case diagram. With there being two actors that interact with the app in question. The main user or Professor who interacts with the app the most. As well as the student who will at most scan their QR code using the Professor’s device as a kiosk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/Use-Case-Diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;system-requirementsflow&quot;&gt;System Requirements/Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also developed a state diagram showing where specific functionality would be found in the app. With there being different requirements for the system at each state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/State-Diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sign-in-and-authentication&quot;&gt;Sign-in and Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;display:grid;grid-template-columns: 49% 49%;grid-gap:5px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Sign-in.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Login Screen Prototype&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Sign-in-prompt.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;List of semesters&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the professor or user first opens the app they will be presented with the first screen and prompted to log in. With login being handled through Google OAuth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semester-list-and-class-list&quot;&gt;Semester List and Class List&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;display:grid;grid-template-columns: 49% 49%;grid-gap:5px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Semester-list.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;List of Semesters&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Add-Semester.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add Semester&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the user is logged in they will then be presented with their list of semesters. Which will be blank for a new user. Otherwise they will have the option to add a new semester or select and existing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;display:grid;grid-template-columns: 49% 49%;grid-gap:5px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Spring-2022-Class-List-select-CS-260.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;List of Classes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Add-Class.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add Class&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a semester is selected they will then be able to add a class an select one in a similar manor to within the semesters list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;student-list&quot;&gt;Student List&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;display:grid;grid-template-columns: 49% 49%;grid-gap:5px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Blank-Student-List.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Empty Class List&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Select-File.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Selecting a file to import&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/Populated-List-From-Import.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Populated class list&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/attendance-tracker/prototype-images/CS-260-Students-select-Adam-Black-Mark-as-present.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mark as present&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the user selects a class they will then be able to perform a variety of actions within a class. Including importing a class list, scanning QR codes, adding student individually or marking them as present manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-functional-requirements&quot;&gt;Non-functional Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also determine that the project had the following nonfunctional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scalable&quot;&gt;Scalable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that the project can be later deployed it needs to be easily scalable to handle more users. While also being able to handle more student information that will result from their being more users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reliable&quot;&gt;Reliable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also needs to reliable compared to the system it is replacing. Otherwise it will cause more problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means it will need to be possible to use the app to take attendance if for some reason the QR codes fail to scan. Among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maintainable&quot;&gt;Maintainable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will also need to be maintainable in order for future teams to be able to add more features. With this being achieved through documentation that will allow future teams to quickly be able to work with the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usable&quot;&gt;Usable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While currently the app will have a single user being the client. The intend is that other professors at the University will be able to use the app. Meaning that the functionality will need to be easily understood and used by more than just a single user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manageable&quot;&gt;Manageable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will also need to be manageable well after all the development teams are gone. In order to simply provide more benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tablet-platform&quot;&gt;Tablet Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will also be used most often on a Android tablet and needs to developed in a manner that allows it to function well on a tablet as requested by the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;android-application&quot;&gt;Android Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again according to the clients requirements it will need to be an android application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;java&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Java requirement being the same as the requirement for it to be an Android Application where it was requested by the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-requirements&quot;&gt;Technical Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project our group made use of an online Database as well as other development tools in Android Studio. With the version control system being used being Git with GitHub as the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-risks&quot;&gt;Project Risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all projects there are some risks involved. And for this project our group determined that the main risk would be that we could fail to meed our goals in the alloted time. We will also be using 3rd party libraries that are subject to possible change. Either in implementation or in the cost they are to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="attendance-tracker" /><summary type="html">A after a few weeks we had determined our official software requirements.

Which was to then allow us to understand the project to an extent and allow us to write our own proposal of what we would do to continue the application’s development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;original-teams-proposal&quot;&gt;Original Team’s Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the original team they had proposed that they would develop an app based of the the specific requirements put forth by the client to best fit their current work flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-work-flow&quot;&gt;Current Work Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current work flow being that students at the beginning of the semester would receive an email from the client asking them to generate a QR code containing their first and last name in a specific format. Such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;last name,first name&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at the beginning or end of a lecture the client would set up a tablet that the student’s would then scan the QR code on. This acting as the confirmation and record that they had attended that lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app that the client used would then export a text file containing all the contents of the QR codes scanned. With each QR code’s contents being on a separate line. This file would then be used to create a master attendance sheet like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Last Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;First Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Days Attended&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Date 1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Date 2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Date 3&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;…&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Date n&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Doe&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;John&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Adams&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Samuel&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Doe&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Jane&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that information in mind the team that build version 1 concluded they needed to be able to import a list of students and their corresponding emails. Afterwards the app would then give the client the ability to generate the Unique QR codes for the students and then send them through email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app would then also replace the app the client was currently using for QR scanning. And allow for the master attendance sheet to be generated from the attendance data stored within the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the app also needing to provide the ability to add individual students to a class list at any time in the event that they were added late for one reason or another. Each class list would also be stored separately as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;constraints&quot;&gt;Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original team of course couldn’t just do this any way they saw fit and where given a few other constraints by the client. The major ones being that it must be written as an Android app in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;original-teams-final-deliverable&quot;&gt;Original Team’s Final Deliverable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original teams deliverable for version one contained some of the functionality proposed in the original proposal. Along with other functionality that lend itself as useful to the user. With this being accomplished using 9 class files according to their final documentation. These class files being the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Class Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;authenticationActivity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Activity indented to be used to allow the user to log in to the app using Google Authentication which was requested by the client after the original proposal. Was not working as intended as of the writing of the original teams documentation.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassListAdapter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Adapter class used to create the list displayed in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SectionViewActivity&lt;/code&gt;. And added the functionality that allowed for students to be removed according to the documentation. (It was later found that a bug in the layout received from the previous team hid this functionality from the user. Which is why there is no removal button in the screenshot below.)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainActivity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Intended to be initialized from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;authenticationActivity&lt;/code&gt; upon the user successfully logging in. Which was not fully implemented at the time the original team wrote their final documentation. The activity would display a list of semesters available to the user which could be selected. Also provided the ability to add and remove semesters from the list.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RecyclerViewAdapter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Adapter class used to display the list of semesters in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainActivity&lt;/code&gt; as well as the list of classes in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SectionListActivity&lt;/code&gt;. As well as providing the ability to select or remove those items from the list which would be triggered in their respective activities.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SectionListActivity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Initialized through the selection of a semester in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainActivity&lt;/code&gt; to display a list of classes within that semester. While also giving the user the ability to interact with the list by adding to or removing classes from it.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SectionViewActivity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Initialized through the selection of a class in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SectionListActivity&lt;/code&gt; to display the list of students within that class. It allows the user to add students individually as well as in bulk. (Not documented within the final documentation but the source our team later worked with did not having the import function working.)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SettingsActivity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Initialized from a menu found in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainActivity&lt;/code&gt; and allows the user to purge the database.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;StudentDetailsActivity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Initialized through the selection of a student in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SectionViewActivity&lt;/code&gt; with it only displaying the student’s name and generated QR code as of the writing of the original teams final documentation.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TinyDB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;As mentioned in the final documentation this was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kcochibili/TinyDB--Android-Shared-Preferences-Turbo&quot;&gt;found on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. And was used to store all the data used within the app. Including semesters, classes, and students.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools-original-team-used&quot;&gt;Tools Original Team Used&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original teams final documentation also made mention of using some other tools. Some of which where expected given it was an android app such as Android Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What came as a bit of a surprise and wasn’t mentioned elsewhere in the document was that they made use of Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some investigating it was found that the previous team was actually making use of both Firebase and TinyDB for the storage of data. Though TinyDB was clearly the more polished implementation. With all the information being presented to the user coming from there. Along with there being no method of syncing the two databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making it so that while Firebase was written to and deleted from. It was never read from. Which we found strange but concluded was likely a result of them planning to use TinyDB for testing with the intention of transitioning to Firebase. Though due to lack of documentation we could not confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that they also used ZXing “Zebra Crossing” for the generation of QR codes within the Student Details screen. And other than that the other tools listed included TinyDB, GitHub, and Android Studio AVD Manager. With these tools allowing easier collaboration as well as the ability to emulate an android device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-proposals-objectives&quot;&gt;Our Proposal’s Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of this in mind the Objectives of our proposal where as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generate-and-distribute-qr-codes&quot;&gt;Generate and Distribute QR Codes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original implementation found in the project worked as a demonstration. But unfortunately did not provide all the functionality required to meet the client’s requirements. So one of our main objectives was to make this functional. Another part of this objective was to fix the importing of students. Which in the original resulted in an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implement-qr-scanning&quot;&gt;Implement QR Scanning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another item that the client had requested and wasn’t complete in the original project was the ability to scan QR codes. So this was another one of our objectives in order to provide a more functional app. There would also be an option to manually mark student’s as present if the QR scanning failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implement-an-attendance-history&quot;&gt;Implement an Attendance History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major portion of the original project that did not appear to be implemented was any sort of record of attendance for students. So we planned on implementing that along with the ability to view a student’s attendance record within the app. As well as provide the ability for the client and future users to export the attendance record of a class in the form of a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implement-authentication-using-oauth&quot;&gt;Implement Authentication using OAuth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally we planned on implementing Authentication using OAuth to sign in with Google. This would not only allow us to prevent unauthorized users for accessing the student records. But also allowed us to more easily make use of Firebase. Allowing us to give specific users access to there own data and not others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would also later allow us to make it possible for a user to view their data across multiple devices making use of the online database to sync between devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that overall is what we originally received for our project and our proposal on how we would continue it. There are some other details that I have left out though for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way it was certainly the beginning of an interesting project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="attendance-tracker" /><summary type="html">As part of the project we received the original teams proposal and final documentation.

With it having been closing in on 4 months since the last post. It’s probably an alright idea to write another post. Can’t let this site become completely dead now can we? Well it’s not like anyone would be heart broken if it disappeared but I care dam it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-summer-complete&quot;&gt;A Summer Complete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall what will likely be my last summer as an “official” student has reached it’s end. It almost feels strange thinking about the fact that in only a few months I’ll be in a situation where summer isn’t really anything different. With work simply being year around rather than during the summer with school the rest of the year. But that’s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the post I made at the beginning of the summer I must say that I clearly didn’t achieve all that I wanted to. My internship took a lot more time than I originally thought it would. But that should have been expected. Not only was I going to be working 8 hour days but I had to get to the office which took a considerable amount of time. So I effectively had 10 hour days. But overall It was amazing how it felt not being physically tired after work. There were days that I came home tired sure. But it was great compared to the physical and mental tiredness that came from working in that factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;incomplete-projects&quot;&gt;Incomplete Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately though it seems that I was a little to ambitious with my summer project plans. Cause while I did work on making some write ups about my Software Engineering Project from last Spring I never touched any of my other projects. Which I’m not exactly happy with myself about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I could make some excuses like not really having a desk to work at any more. Or being given other tasks that needed done around the house. That’s exactly what they are. Excuses. Excuses of why I didn’t take the time to work on any of my projects. Though I’ll likely have the time to do some of them now. It’s honestly amazing how much “free” time a college like me has. Even with a full course load I have had more free time at school then I’ve had the last few summers. But then again. I guess that’s part of being an Adult now isn’t it. You don’t have time for things because you have to work to sustain yourself and possibly others as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;internship&quot;&gt;Internship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I finally got a taste of the industry during my Internship. Which I have 0 things to complain about. I got to interact with systems I had never heard of until now. And was able to at the very least see what my future employment might look like. Though it was only a small sample. With most of the people I was working with being remote while I was in an office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still having now worked on a professional project was nice. And I feel has better prepared me with how my Senior Capstone will be managed. While also exposing me to things that I’ll have to work with later. Such as the need to log hours to specific tasks. Documenting changes done to a system. And finding bugs in code that I’m still surprised made it as far as they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-notes&quot;&gt;Final Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said this post is becoming me rambling. I do plan on trying to write more frequently in the future on projects I’m working on. But for now this is all I got at the moment. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="ramblings" /><summary type="html">And so begins the Fall Semester of 2022.

The Spring Semester for 2022 is now complete. Even if I’m mildly late for this post. But hey, the only person setting deadlines for this blog is myself. That of course that doesn’t mean I’m exactly happy with how late it is. But life happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;classes-passed-successfully&quot;&gt;Classes Passed Successfully&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way though I’m rather happy with how I finished the semester when it comes to my classes. They where even high enough that it improve my GPA by a whole 0.02. It wasn’t much. But considering how many credit hours in classes I’ve already taken it was a substantial increase. Bringing me up to a 3.84 GPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-engineering-project&quot;&gt;Software Engineering Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also able to work on a Software Engineering project due to my Software Engineering Class. Our team received version one of a project that was developed the previous semester. The main idea of the project, which was ‘sponsored’ by a professor, was to assist the professor in taking attendance. The idea being the professor would use an app that would send QR codes to students at the beginning of the semester. The professor would then set up the same app up on a tablet as a kiosk of sorts for students to scan those QR codes on. Acting as a check-in at the beginning or end of lectures. The app would then provide other features for the professor that I plan on writing about in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it wasn’t different from the professor’s current method of taking attendance. Where she would request students to generate QR codes that would contain their names in a specific format. The professor would then set up a tablet that would scan the QR codes and, to the understanding of the team I worked with, generate a text file that would contain all the names that where scanned. The professor would then have a file for each day and later combine the contents of those files into a single file that would act as a final record of attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this system has worked for the past two years, having been implemented due to Covid-19, it isn’t the best. Requiring the professor the manage multiple text files. One for each day and for each lecture the professor hosts. And until the professor combines the files they don’t exactly have a full picture of the attendance records. The goal of this project was to make the process easier and allow a better continuous picture of the current attendance situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And overall it was a very interesting experience. Not only did we learn how to develop an Android App using Java, but we also learned how to integrate OAuth into an app as well as using an online Database. And I will certainly be writing more about it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-what-about-the-summer&quot;&gt;Now What About the Summer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week of finals I was a little disappointed when it came to what was to come during the summer. Without an internship prospect at the time the plan was for me to return to the same summer job I’ve had for the last few years. Just so I could earn enough to pay for my last two semesters in college. Which would allow me to continue with my plan to graduate debt free. And I wasn’t exactly thrilled with the prospect with again not work in a job that uses my degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And darn did that change fast. I’m sitting here not only having interviewed for internships. But now actually going through the process or being hired for one. And I’m now have the ability to validate at least some of my skill outside of a college setting. Because sure, I can and have passed all but a couple of my class with at least an A-. But at this point I have yet to work any other job other than a factory job. And haven’t been able to self validate my own skill. Now I have the opportunity and I couldn’t be happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that I also planned on building an app that would contain games what where originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://annarchive.com/files/Basic_Computer_Games_Microcomputer_Edition.pdf&quot;&gt;BASIC Computer Games Microcomputer Edition&lt;/a&gt;. With their being a current project to rewrite the games in to modern languages found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And while I didn’t plan on using the code found in the current rewrite project it I was planning on using as a resource on the rules of the games in question and how they functioned. But as the keen reader will see I’m referring to this in past tense. That being because that is something I wanted to do. But currently have found that I may not have the time. Though plans change as clearly seen by my new job opportunity. Maybe finally getting out of a factory and off of second shift will allow me to have the time and more importantly the energy to be able to start another project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-is-looking-bright&quot;&gt;The Future is Looking Bright&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall though I’m thrilled with the outlook for the future. With an internship in the works and my final year of college fast approaching. And with my next few semester having interesting classes such as Human Computer Interaction, Web App Development, and Project Management. I’ll even be working on my Senior Capstone Project. And as of now I couldn’t be happier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="ramblings" /><summary type="html">Well. The Spring Semester for 2022 is now complete.

&lt;p&gt;But at least if I place them here they can act as reminders of what I have done. And can even be used to possibly continue the projects later. Even if the terrain generation project would require a near complete rewrite. Darn I was stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also modified the layout for Project pages. I can now enable and disable the Posts section on them. Eventually I intend on making it so that is controlled by whether posts within the correct category exist.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provided me with 3 swappable side panels each with their own array of buttons which could be configured how I saw
fit. This allowed me to set up buttons on my mouse to swap virtual desktops among other things. Unfortunately though
the left mouse button began to fail sometime around the first year of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I just kind of ignored the issue. Because if I placed my finger in a specific spot to click the issue seemed
resolved. And that was fine until now. Where it is to the point I can’t click and drag anything. While also double clicking
anything I try to single click. One specifically annoying instance of this was when I closed four tabs in chrome when I was
trying to only close one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after finally getting tired of it I decided to see if I could fix it. Having replaced batteries in smart watches and
laptops I figured it wouldn’t be to difficult. At least not as difficult as replacing the battery in a Moto 360 first
generation watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-one-3282022&quot;&gt;Day One (3/28/2022)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Razer+Naga+Trinity+OMRON+D2FC-F-K(50M)+Micro+Switch+Replacement/126856&quot;&gt;iFixit guide&lt;/a&gt;
for the repair I began my the tear down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up was getting access to circuit board itself. This required removing the skates off the bottom to get access to the
screws. Followed by the disconnecting of a ribbon cable that leads to the side panel connection and another cable that
leads to some more buttons on the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mouse-repair/top-shell.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Top shell of mouse&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then to provide easier access to the board itself I removed the right side panel which isn’t held in by any screws. It is
just blocked from coming off it’s posts by the top of the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mouse-repair/side-panel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Right side panel&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to get my first good look at the switch I’ll be replacing. That being the left button in the following
picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the challenge of getting the circuit board off the bottom plate. This requires the removal of four screws. Two of
which are under the scroll wheel which needed to be removed. The other two where simple enough to get access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a bit of work I got myself an empty bottom panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to finally confirm that the switch in use was the D2FC-F-K. Just with green coloring since it’s a Razer
product apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the mouse did not get to this state unscathed. With one of the sockets for the plugs breaking in the process.
The plug still fits and the connections still seem fine. So I’m not terribly worried about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2-4152022&quot;&gt;Day 2 (4/15/2022)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later due to due to a miscommunication about a soldering iron came the task of de-soldering and soldering on the new switch. Originally for the sake of sanity I was going to replace both the left and right switch. But it was found that the de-soldering of the switch was more difficult than originally anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When de-soldering my switch I found out that my iron couldn’t get hot enough in order to remove the switch. Which I hadn’t expected because it had been fine when I used it to solder on other projects. But then again this was the first time I had to actually de-solder something. So I again had to borrow another iron. Once that was done though I due to the amount of time it took to de-solder the switch I decided not to replace both switches. And in all reality it’s probably fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mouse-repair/final-repair.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New switch soldered on the mouse.&quot; /&gt;
Final switch replacement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-notes&quot;&gt;Final Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I’m happy with my repair. The mouse is now in working order and for the $26.30 I spent I got 5 switches, and two sets of skates. So I have enough materials for another repair or two. Depending on how careful I am with the skates during removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though if I’m honest with myself I should just buy a new mouse entirely. While it is possible to replace the switch it is difficult. With the largest difficulty being the de-soldering of the switch itself. And, at least for me, the final removal resulted in the old switch being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also want to get a better soldering iron if I want to de-solder in the future. Cause while my current iron is fine for normal soldering it just couldn’t provide the heat needed to de-solder. With this lesson being learned the hard way for me. I do not want to spend 2 hours trying to de-solder a switch again. So a better iron will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="electronics-repair" /><summary type="html">So I had purchased this mouse November of 2020 for a grand total of $65.

The pages though are simple enough and are more or less a modified home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Projects page for example loops through all the pages on the site. Selecting only those that have the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;project&lt;/code&gt; layout. Which is then presented through a modified version of the list found for the posts on the Home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project layout when does something similar. Except it does it based off of a front matter variable. The value of that variable is then compared to the categories of the posts. If the post is apart of the correct category it is then added to the list as a post about that project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should at least make it so that all posts about the same project can be easily found in one place. Or that’s the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far there are two projects on the site. But eventually more will be added. Until then. This is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note the assets folder for this site is now organized my file type. The plan being to keep going that. Making it easier for the same asset to be used in multiple places. Specifically if I end up using p5.js more on this site.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><summary type="html">Having wanted to have specific pages for my projects I finally went through and actually did it.

Progress has been made while working on this project. Though not as much progress as I would have liked given It’s been nearly 2 months sense my last post on it. But progress has been made never the less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parallelization-of-retrieval-of-information&quot;&gt;Parallelization of retrieval of information.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in my &lt;a href=&quot;/readme-generation-project/2021/12/23/README-Generation-Project.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; on slower connections the program suffered. And through some informal testing I found that while I have little control of the speed of making a single request I do have control of the number of requests at once. This doesn’t seem to affect the speed of an individual request. But it can greatly increase how fast all the requests can be made and satisfied. This isn’t much of a surprise. As I had parallelized this process in a previous iteration of the project that is described in my last post. This was done using pthreads. Which was an interesting experience. This time around though I decided to use OpenMP to make the requests run in parallel. The reasoning behind this being purely because I saw examples of it in my Programming Language Design class and I wanted to try to use it. But I did not anticipate in an issue I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;issued-with-openmp&quot;&gt;Issued with OpenMP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue in question came when I was testing for memory leaks. And I found that for some reason I had a memory leak when I was using OpenMP. And thinking that there was no way for the library to be at fault I thought it was something I did. So I proceeded to spend a few hours pulling my hair out trying to find the source the memory leak that I clearly caused. But then I realized that if I removed OpenMP that it eliminated the memory leak. And so I did a little looking and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@auraham/pseudo-memory-leaks-when-using-openmp-11a383cc4cf9&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on the subject. It turns out that there is a pseudo memory leak that valgrind detects due to how OpenMP allocates itself memory. So that ended that hair pulling adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-was-parallelized&quot;&gt;What Was Parallelized&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I ended up making two main things run in parallel within this project. Those being the retrieval of individual project’s descriptions and the retrieval of the links for the projects. These two tasks before they ran in parallel took the most amount of time. And while it can still take some time it is greatly improved. For example in one test I did without them running in parallel it took the whole program 1:26.83 to run. Where with them running in parallel it took 0:23.32. Which is 330% faster. And while it isn’t always that much of a difference it is more often than not faster. I also only tested this on my laptop which has 2 cores and 4 threads. So it’s possible that it will preform better on other computers. But at this point it works well enough. And from when I’ve tested on slower connections it still improves the time it takes for the program to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;progress-indication&quot;&gt;Progress Indication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I did sense the last most was add a progress indicator. This was also mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;/readme-generation-project/2021/12/23/README-Generation-Project.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; as something I wanted to do. And I must say it’s simple but I’m pleased with how it operates. It simply makes use of the carriage return to repeatedly overwrite the same line within the terminal. With each overwrite printing the name of the task being preformed, the progress bar and a counter of how many items have been processed and the total number of items that need to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But due to some of the tasks being run in parallel it presents it’s own challenges. Which were solved in this case by making use of OpenMP’s critical section. In this case it protects a counter variable that increments the number of completed items and when that number is updated the progress indicator is printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the progress indicator reaches it final value it then also adds the word DONE and prints a new line character to start the next line. It’s not the most fancy of progress indicators but it works well for what I’m doing. I also made it so I can make use of it else where if I want. With the size of the progress bar being adjustable using a single variable. The progress bar part of the indicator can also be disabled by setting that same variable to any number less than 1. Though I’m not sure how useful a progress bar with only one indicator section would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-progress-indicator&quot;&gt;Example of Progress Indicator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-tackle-next&quot;&gt;What to Tackle Next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still haven’t worked on everything I mentioned in the last post that I wanted to add to this program. Such as adding proper command line arguments and documentation. But I’d also like to make it so that the output is organized into categories or folders. But before I do that I think I’ll need to make some sort of config file to control and store that kind of information. Either way it should be at least something to work on. And the annoyances I mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;/readme-generation-project/2021/12/23/README-Generation-Project.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; are mostly resolved now. So I’d call that a win.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="readme-generation-project" /><summary type="html">Well. Progress has been made while working on this project.
