I had originally planned on posting about my 3D printers as my next post. But that has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you get a short post following up on the repair I posted about &lt;a href=&quot;/_posts/2024-11-11-mouse-repair-followup.md&quot;&gt;April 17th of 2022&lt;/a&gt; where I repaired my Naga Trinity’s left click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-follow-up&quot;&gt;The Follow Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. After around 2 years the switch once again began failing in the same darn way. Where it would double-click. Likely due to corrosion within the switch from slight arcing. Or at least that’s my best guess. And beyond my best judgment, because I had completely forgotten how difficult it was to remove the switch. I decided I needed to repair it again. With the same iron that was a poor choice last time because the battery on my new one wasn’t charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repair at this point does appear to be a success in terms of restoring functionality once again. The whole job took about 75 minutes this time compared to the 2 hours of soldering I fought through last time. This time it was 10 minutes of me trying to find the screws to realize I had two sets of skids on the mouse. And another hour of struggling to desolder the switch again. Once again destructively removing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey. She’s once again fixed. This time with no extra materials needing to be purchased. I just used what I had from last time. But this experience CONCRETELY confirms the fact I need a better iron for this kind of thing. I also need to make sure to put the kittens away next time so they don’t decide that the screws on my work mat are toys. Because I am now down a screw. But I’m “fine” with that since it’s my mouse. Not like I plan on selling it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also appears that since the last time I did this Razer appears to have replaced the Naga Trinity with the Naga Pro V2. So I might get myself one of those if this sucker crokes again. First I’m going to wait for the 2-year mark to hit for its release to see if it suffers the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way. HOPEFULLY the next post is about my printers. That’s the plan atleast.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="electronics-repair" /><summary type="html">Well, here I am again.

This update was mostly about bug fixes. But does include some new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-improvements&quot;&gt;General Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall most of the changes were to make it easier to develop this plugin further in the future. Such as by automating building and releasing versions on Github when something new is pushed to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch. This also included refactoring some code to reduce some confusion I was having with my organization. Among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upgrades-to-release-pipeline&quot;&gt;Upgrades to Release Pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the automation of the release pipeline, I ended up automating a couple of other tasks as well. Such as the automatic generation and setting of version numbers within builds. Which is currently achieved using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ldflags&lt;/code&gt; at build time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with that I also gave myself the ability to have two different release types. One that is triggered manually (prereleases) and another that is triggered automatically (full releases). The logic to this being that I want all full releases to be automatically built when I must to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;. Whereas with pre-releases that I might release in the development of a full release, I wouldn’t want to be constantly generated. So they are triggered manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ended up building a bash script that looks at the current git repository and spits out a version number. Allowing me to “never” think about how I’m numbering things again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-logs-can-be-nice&quot;&gt;Change Logs Can Be Nice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the automation of releases, I also ended up setting up a method of writing and maintaining a change log. Currently, there are three files &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MAJOR_CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MINOR_CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt;. With &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt; being all changes throughout the history of the project. The other two files are then being used in the release process to populate the release message body. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MAJOR_CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt; for the full releases and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MINOR_CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt; for the pre-releases. Simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding these files (and their semi-static location) also allowed for me to add a Change Log message within the plugin’s info page within Gotify. With it currently listing only the most recent changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;refactoring&quot;&gt;Refactoring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for refactoring. I did not name all my packages in the most sane way when I started. And with my plan to expand the project further. Well, that wouldn’t be wise to leave as is. So before it gets too big I decided to try to come up with some more sane and descriptive package names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how well I can maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-through-obscurity&quot;&gt;Security Through Obscurity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for functionality. The only thing that I wouldn’t call a full-fledged feature is the fact that Discord Webhook Links (and in the future other secrets) are now hidden by default unless you hover/click them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is now that I would like to note. Much of the functionality of this plugin is based on my use. And that includes the fact that keys are currently transmitted back to the browser for the transmitters. In the future, I may make it so that isn’t the case. But for now. I do not have an explicit reason to develop said feature due to my current setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these features are simple. And for good reason. The goal was to do this in a month. (Mostly because my projects need a limited timeline otherwise they tend to expand.) So they are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transmitters now record how many times they have been used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log messages for the plugin are now accessible in the UI.
    - Log messages in UI are cleared on reboot but are still sent to Standard Out as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Relay Transmitters
    - Discord Advance
        - Makes use of Discord’s Embeds that can be in Webhook messages. 
        - Embeds are not currently fully utilized at this point.
        - The current implementation is more or less the same as the old Discord Transmitter.
    - Pushbullet
        - Very similar formatting to the original Discord Transmitter. Just through Pushbullet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bug-fixes-every-project-needs-its-exterminator&quot;&gt;Bug Fixes (Every project needs it’s exterminator)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as with many projects. A few bugs are likely to find their way in. And I am not impervious to bugs. So I had a few to fix. Unfortunately, I didn’t discover them until running the plugin myself for a couple of days. They are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed the issues that caused the Transmitters to be spammed with empty messages.
    - Typically happened when the server Gotify was running on had a hiccup elsewhere.
    - Prevention measures put in place to prevent them in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corrected method of reconnecting after a connection is unexpectedly terminated.
    - This could also cause the issue above if it were to happen in a specific case.
    - Currently, if a connection is lost. It will now wait 1 second before trying to reestablish itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-thats-that&quot;&gt;And That’s That&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in all honesty that’s it. Most of this was a rehashing of what you can find in the project’s changes logs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CEKlopfenstein/gotify-repeater/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But I’ve set myself a goal of a post a month. So here it is. At least it has some value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a good one. And see y’all next month where I hope to talk about 3D printing. Hopefully, everything pans out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-posts" /><category term="golang" /><category term="gotify-repeater-plugin" /><summary type="html">I am pleased to announce the release of 2024.2.36 of the plugin.

This is for a few reasons. But one of the reasons I remember doing so was because of a Minecraft Mod called Computercraft. The mod itself added computers as well as robots, called turtles, that players could program in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lua.org/&quot;&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt;. And I did this quite a bit and it allowed me to get over some self-doubts. As a result of not wanting to test my programs in the limited environment of the game. I later installed a Lua Interpreter. Which allowed for the creation of quite a few other projects I did. And while most are effectively lost at this point. It was a start to my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a few years later. In my senior year of High School, I ended up finding another “game” that allowed me to discover a fascination with simulations. As well as the idea of programming within a contest. That “game” was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halite_AI_Programming_Competition&quot;&gt;Halite&lt;/a&gt;. And while I never ended up participating in an active contest I enjoyed making bots that could play against each other. Though I can’t say I was ever really good. Either way, it was added to an early version of my Projects list. Though without much description of what to do around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-present&quot;&gt;The Present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here we are. It’s nearly 5 years later and I’m finally getting around to it. Unfortunately many of the original resources for Halite 1 at this point have mostly been pulled offline beyond the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite&quot;&gt;Open Source Repositories on Github&lt;/a&gt;. With the old domains such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;halite.io&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2016.halite.io&lt;/code&gt; are now redirected to the company that created the contest. Who seems to have decided to take all the Halite sites down sometime between September 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2022 and October 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2022 according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220101000000*/https://halite.io/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. With all requests to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;halite.io&lt;/code&gt; being redirected after October 2022. However, it also indicates that the last successful capture was a 3xx redirect. Aligning with the closing of their last contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the last remaining official resource outside of the Internet Archive being the Github repository. I decided that I would attempt to resurrect the site. At least in a static capacity. I might try to do more in the future. But for now. That’s my set goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;containerize-the-site&quot;&gt;Containerize The Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first up was to get a “working” containerization of the Website running. Though the instructions within the repository are for a full install of Ubuntu, I’m going this route to reduce my system requirements. As flawed as that idea may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CEKlopfenstein/Halite-1/blob/Website-Docker-Container/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;Contribution Guide&lt;/a&gt; it should be as simple as running some install scripts. But the scripts for whatever reason didn’t work right off the back. So I broke the scripts into RUN commands for building the Docker Image. And this worked for the most part. At least from appearances. The problem though boiled down to the fact that the scripts were meant for a VM. Where installing something like Apache would result in a running service. So I had to figure out how to configure Apache and start it within the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after some digging in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CEKlopfenstein/Halite-1/blob/master/admin/md/INSTALL.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; folder in the repository I found another set of install instructions. And while this didn’t solve all of my problems it did give me enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CEKlopfenstein/Halite-1/blob/1df28ef85666b220b2878d16bedad5befc8f04b3/Dockerfile&quot;&gt;get a working Dockerfile&lt;/a&gt;. Though it’s not without it’s possible issues. But for now, it will work for what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-issues-and-considerations&quot;&gt;Other Issues and Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I had a working way of running the web server then came a couple of other things I need to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of which is in what format I wish to publish a static version of the site. For this project’s timeline, I don’t have the time to fully rewrite the site to be new. And that was never the intention. But what I don’t want is for my version of the site to be mistaken as the original. Or for an attempt to take credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is the number of “dead links” like the links to the forum. And while I have access to the “homepage’s” code I don’t have access to the forum’s code or data. And given it likely had quite a bit of user data I don’t think I’d want to handle that. There are quite a few dead links and even a few dead paths. Such as downloads to resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with those issues in mind. My plan is as follows. I’m going to modify the Home page and the footer to label the site as a copy of the original. Likely with a link to an Internet Archive version of the site. As well as a link to the original repository. I will also be going through and removing links that lead to dead paths. And for links that lead to the forum I plan on replacing them with equivalent links to Internet Archive versions of it. They might not load as fast as the original forum. But they should at least provide connections to pages that are lost otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deployment&quot;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for deployment, I plan to use Github Pages as I have before. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66610/how-can-i-create-a-site-in-php-and-have-it-generate-a-static-version&quot;&gt;And using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I created a static copy of the site. Allowing it to be easily hosted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-plans&quot;&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this monthly project done. I will likely move on to the next one. However, I do have plans for this. Eventually, I want to better containerize the whole thing. As well as produce some documentation for it. Unfortunately, my current goal of a project a month does not give me the time necessary to do everything. But then again. If I didn’t have the time constraint I’d probably never get things done. So it’s a double-edged sword I suppose. Either way see you all next time. The results of this page are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://ceklopfenstein.github.io/Halite-1/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-posts" /><category term="halite-1" /><summary type="html">I first got seriously into programming sometime around my freshman year of High School.

  &lt;p&gt;For those who missed the last post. The writing and publishing of the previous post was delayed. So this post intended for April 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; was also delayed. I plan on being back on schedule for the May 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; post. See ya then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are again. Another month another post. Except this time it isn’t a project as much as it will be a repository of some information that I would like to share. So this isn’t going to be a single-flowing article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I was asked if I could look at an electric sign and see if I could get it working. This was after they had already called the help desk and gotten nowhere. However, they were able to determine their USB to RS-232 adapter was working. So I was asked if I could assist and do some digging. And those efforts bore fruit this time. So with that in mind, this post exists as a cleaner form of the notes I took while doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off the sign.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait at least 30 seconds (allow the sign to fully turn off) and turn it back on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record the next 16 lines of text that the sign provides you. They provide the following information in order. Example values are in parentheses.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Product Name (Galaxy®)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Display Size (Row x Column)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shading (64 Mono)&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Software Address (SW:XX)&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Display Name Description (Galaxy Row x Column)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the sign has listed the last item it will proceed with displaying the last stored settings. If it is the first time the sign has booted a pixel in the lower right-hand corner will flash to indicate that it is on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend writing down this information somewhere you can easily find it later. As it is useful when configuring the sign once you have Venus 1500 installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation-of-sql-express&quot;&gt;Installation of SQL Express&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During testing, it was found that for the most reliable success in the installation of Venus 1500, it is best to manually install SQL Express first. Before attempting to install Venus 1500. Even though the installer for Venus 1500 is supposed to install the SQL Server itself. It appears to fail relatively frequently. (Or at least in my experience of around 20 attempts total.) Official instructions are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.daktronics.com/en-us/support/kb/DD3302758&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or using the &lt;a href=&quot;#links-to-resources-used&quot;&gt;Links to Resources Used&lt;/a&gt; section. Follow them as they are written. I did not find any needed changes. Download link for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57473&quot;&gt;SQL Express 2014&lt;/a&gt; is available at the link or in the &lt;a href=&quot;#links-to-resources-used&quot;&gt;Links to Resources Used&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation-of-venus-1500&quot;&gt;Installation of Venus 1500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For installing Venus 1500 V4 following the instructions posted on their site is advised and can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.daktronics.com/en-us/support/venus-1500-learning-center/download&quot;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt; along with the download for the software. However, I would advise installing &lt;a href=&quot;#installation-of-sql-express&quot;&gt;the SQL server&lt;/a&gt; manually due to some issues with the installer failing to do it on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I have one other piece of advice while going through the install wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/venus-1500/RestartDialog.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, in a dialog I was unable to capture, the install process may ask you to attempt to either restart a service or reboot the PC later. If this option is presented to you I recommend performing a reboot. This is for a couple of reasons. For example. If it fails to restart the service, at least from my testing, it reverts your install process. Whereas if you select the option to restart later it can complete its installation. I would also suggest you manually restart rather than clicking &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt; in the above dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-with-the-sign&quot;&gt;Connecting with the Sign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the wizard will work just fine for most applications. The one thing I’d like to note is you will need to ensure that the USB to RS232 adapter is assigned to COM1 or COM2. This was the main issue I ran into when assisting with the sign. We could get the program to boot. Everything else worked. But we could not communicate with the sign through RS232. With the adapter not even indicating activity using it’s TX and RX lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What appears to be the issue is for some reason Windows 10 does not like to properly use Serial devices with the correct protocal for RS232 on anything other than COM1 or COM2. I actually remembered reading this somewhere. But unfortunately I can’t seem the original source. And attempting to Google it leads to people having problems with the Adapter itself that may or may not be related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Open the Windows Device Manager and find the Ports list.
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;You can get to Windows device Manager by right clicking the Start Menu.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/venus-1500/step1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Click &quot;Show hidden devices&quot;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;This may not be needed if you already see your device listed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/venus-1500/step2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/venus-1500/step3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Enter the properties of your device.
        &lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/venus-1500/step4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;width:100%;max-width:400px&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Go the &quot;Port Settings&quot; Tab.
        &lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/venus-1500/step5.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Click &quot;Advanced&quot;
        &lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/venus-1500/step6.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Click the &quot;COM Port Number:&quot; dropdown to change the port.
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;If your serial adapter is already on COM1 or COM2 then you can stop here.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;If your serial adapter is not on COM1 or COM2 then change it and click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;If COM1 or COM2 have a &quot;(in use)&quot; beside them you will need to determine which device is on it and change it first. Using the steps above.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;div style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I would like to note. This was originally planned for completion and release on the 15th of March. That time has come and gone. And as a result, I would like to say that the April post may also be delayed. The normal schedule will hopefully be restored by May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since sometime in November I’ve been running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gotify.net/&quot;&gt;Gotify Server&lt;/a&gt; on my Proxmox Instance. With the initial intention being to use it to receive notifications from Proxmox. And for that, Gotify functions fine. The issue though is that it’s missing on feature I wanted. And that being the ability for the server to act as a repeater/proxy for other services that can send out notifications. But since Gotify has plugin support I figured I could write up that functionality myself. So I got started on figuring out how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-setup&quot;&gt;Project Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now luckily enough finding the documentation for it was pretty easy. They have a GitHub Repository called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gotify/plugin-template&quot;&gt;plugin-template&lt;/a&gt; (what a creative name) that provides the needed files for a simple “hello world” plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it didn’t work quite write on the Ubuntu VM have been SSHing into to tinker with Go. The first of being that I have not configured Docker to be able to be run without using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;. But that was a simple fix by just adding it to the Makefile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue. Which seemed strange. Was the inability to find a program called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gomod-cap&lt;/code&gt;. With the commands originally being &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gomod-cap -from ${BUILDDIR}/gotify-server.mod -to go.mod&lt;/code&gt;. Looking through the Makefile I found that one of the Makefile’s targets appears to “install” it using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GO111MODULE=off go get -u github.com/gotify/plugin-api/cmd/gomod-cap&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately, while that was functioning. It didn’t install it in such a way that it would be runnable as a stand-alone command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead I replaced &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gomod-cap&lt;/code&gt; within that command to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go run github.com/gotify/plugin-api/cmd/gomod-cap&lt;/code&gt; which works like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; world. Where it downloads the script as a temp file and executes it. Now that’s likely not the best solution but that’s what I did to get started. Eventually, I’ll get around to understanding why it didn’t work. But on with the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I modified it to Makefile to give me a target that would build the amd64 version of the plugin and then place it in the correct location where a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; file would pick it up for a test gotify server. Loading the newest version of the plugin into a gotify server every time I ran the target. Which finally gave me an environment to at least test whether this idea would even work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-prototype&quot;&gt;Initial Prototype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first up I created a VERY simple demo/prototype just to make sure what I was going to do was even achievable. Initially, I had thought that there would be the ability to hook into an event listener. But that doesn’t exist directly within the Plugin interface. So what I ended up doing, and what someone else did in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elgonlabs/gotify-emailer/&quot;&gt;different plugin that does this to send emails&lt;/a&gt; after the fact, was to use the REST API to get a WebSocket connection that does exactly what I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That requires two things then. An HTTP or HTTPS path to the gotify server, cause we can’t guarantee it will be within docker or on a different port than standard. And a client token that can be used for authentication. So this being a proof of concept I simply hard-coded those values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I ended up fiddling around and failing quite frequently to get a Websocket to connect when the server started up and the plugin enabled itself. Until I realized that I was attempting to connect to nothing because Gotify initializes the plugins before it starts accepting traffic. 🤦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after that was fixed. I then created a loop that would read the messages received from the socket and send out a Discord Webhook every time it received something. And what would you know? It worked. After some trial and error and learning more about how Go handles JSON. But hey can’t make an omelet without breaking a few legs. But it worked as a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-0&quot;&gt;Version 0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I wanted to make something with what I considered the bare minimum of functional, at least for a kind of Version 0. So I came up with a list of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must Properly Handle enabling and disabling of the plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No Hard Coded Values. (URL for Gotify, Client Token, Discord Webhook)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configurable from within Gotity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple Formatted Discord Message&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information about the plugin displayed within Gotify “Displayer” per the recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of which are relatively simple. Most of it more or less is refactoring the already existing demo and properly handling the errors that it might run into. But the result looked like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/assets/image-box.css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;image0&quot; class=&quot;image-box-modal&quot;&gt;
        
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gotify-plugin/Plugin_Screen_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/assets/modal.css&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;image0modal&quot; class=&quot;modal&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;modal-content&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;span id=&quot;image0modal-close&quot; class=&quot;close&quot;&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gotify-plugin/Plugin_Screen_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        // Open Modal Event Listener
        document.getElementById(&quot;image0&quot;).onclick = function () {
            document.getElementById(&quot;image0modal&quot;).style.display = &quot;block&quot;;
            // One of Two Modal Close Event Listeners (Click outside of Modal)
            window.onclick = function (event) {
                if (event.target == document.getElementById(&quot;image0modal&quot;)) {
                    document.getElementById(&quot;image0modal&quot;).style.display = &quot;none&quot;;
                }
            }
        }

        // One of Two Modal Close Event Listeners (Click X to close)
        document.getElementById(&quot;image0modal-close&quot;).onclick = function () {
            document.getElementById(&quot;image0modal&quot;).style.display = &quot;none&quot;;
        }


    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And overall it functions exactly as I was hoping it would though it’s not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovered-flawsnext-version&quot;&gt;Discovered Flaws/Next Version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I deployed version 0 of my plugin to my Gotify Server I decided to run some tests. Unfortunately, these tests presented some issues I didn’t have when running it for short periods when developing. Such as the fact that the plugin currently can not recover itself in the event the Websocket is closed for whatever reason. Requiring the user to disable and enable the plugin to fix it. Another issue and one I didn’t think I’d have to deal with is the fact that a Gotify event message can contain extra information. Which I discovered Proxmox makes use of. So that now needs to be handled and can’t be ignored. So onward with the improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-1---working-so-much-better&quot;&gt;Version 1 - Working So Much Better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now first off with version 1 came the corrections to quite a few bugs from testing. Which included the inability of the plugin to recover from connection issues. And while I’m not an expert at this point I think I’ve more or less solved it in this case. The problem with Proxmox was also solved relatively quickly by simply not parsing the entire message structure. Only parsing the parts I’m currently using which at this point seems to be the smarter move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But fixing bugs wasn’t the only thing I wanted in version one. I also wanted to improve the interface for configuring the plugin. And while the Configurator is probably great for some projects. I wanted an interface that could guide the user. At least to some degree. So I began to implement it using the Webhooker Gotify provides and &lt;a href=&quot;https://htmx.org/&quot;&gt;HTMX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I must say. I can see the usefulness of &lt;a href=&quot;https://htmx.org/&quot;&gt;HTMX&lt;/a&gt;. It allowed me to not have to mess with front-end Javascript to be able to lazy load data or even submit data back to the server. You just have the HTTP server, or in this case, the Gotify server, to respond with properly formatted HTML, which provided me with a very simple way to easily build the kind of interface I needed. At least once I had the time and learned some of its quirks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-box&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;image1&quot; class=&quot;image-box-modal&quot;&gt;
        
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gotify-plugin/Plugin_Interface.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;image1modal&quot; class=&quot;modal&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;modal-content&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;span id=&quot;image1modal-close&quot; class=&quot;close&quot;&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gotify-plugin/Plugin_Interface.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        // Open Modal Event Listener
        document.getElementById(&quot;image1&quot;).onclick = function () {
            document.getElementById(&quot;image1modal&quot;).style.display = &quot;block&quot;;
            // One of Two Modal Close Event Listeners (Click outside of Modal)
            window.onclick = function (event) {
                if (event.target == document.getElementById(&quot;image1modal&quot;)) {
                    document.getElementById(&quot;image1modal&quot;).style.display = &quot;none&quot;;
                }
            }
        }

        // One of Two Modal Close Event Listeners (Click X to close)
        document.getElementById(&quot;image1modal-close&quot;).onclick = function () {
            document.getElementById(&quot;image1modal&quot;).style.display = &quot;none&quot;;
        }


    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In creating the interface I also ended up adding some new features that can be seen in the image above. Such as the ability to more easily set the token that the plugin will use to listen for messages. As well as the ability to manage “transmitters” which is what I’m going to be calling the different destinations that the plugin can relay messages to. With there currently only being two. The “Log Transmitter” and one for Discord Webhooks. Eventually, I plan on expanding the selection but for now, this works for demonstration purposes and my current use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is being built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://htmx.org/&quot;&gt;HTMX&lt;/a&gt; for the interaction with the server itself (all the APIs I created require a valid token) and Bootstrap 5 for some CSS. Which I’m pretty pleased about. And now with that done and working I can comfortably begin the next month’s project. Now to figure out what it is. Well, I have some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone else may find this plugin useful it is currently available in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CEKlopfenstein/gotify-repeater&quot;&gt;public Github Repo here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-posts" /><category term="golang" /><category term="gotify-repeater-plugin" /><summary type="html">I would like to note.

It’s that time of month again. And this time I’ve been tinkering around with &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.dev/&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; by building a small program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program in question does a couple things. The intention being to pull data from a Google Sheet that I update with financial information and place that data into an SQLite database file. So first things first. Getting Google Sheets to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-sheets-authentication&quot;&gt;Google Sheets Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google Sheets API, and other Google APIs those that interact with user data, require the use of OAuth2. Now I could have used an already developed Library for it. In fact Google has an official one for Go. Except I prefer to write my own. Especially for personal projects. And given the Sheet’s REST API isn’t to complicated I decided to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it turns out that I’m by far the first one to want to do this. In fact someone wrote a rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://rsseau.fr/2020-10-28-google-oauth&quot;&gt;nice article&lt;/a&gt; on how to Authenticate simply using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cURL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-golang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// client id and secret obtained from Google API Console:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Status: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Access Token: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Access_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above was effectively what I started out with. Using the instructions provided in the article I converted it to be useful in Go. And to test that whether the access token I used the following. With the token being placed within a HTTP Header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-golang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NewRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MethodGet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/tokeninfo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Authorization&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Bearer &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;access_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;defer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ReadAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that the ability to get and use the access token I then needed a way to ensure that the access token maintains. And from doing some research I learned that this is possible with using a Go &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;channel&lt;/code&gt; and a Ticker. Which was actually really simple. Then then led to mean learning how to make methods for Go &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;structs&lt;/code&gt;. Do I then effectively packaged all of the Google authentication into a single package. With the access_token not being accessible outside of the package. Instead when you need to preform a request with the access token I have provided a method that is effectively a mapping of a basic &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request with the needed header added within it. The method then returning the body of the response or the error in the event something when wrong. The code below effectively being the same as in the code block directly above this paragraph except using the new Methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-golang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;queryResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;PRINT INFO ERROR:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;PRINT INFO: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;queryResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this to prevent the need to constantly sign in. The program also saves the refresh token in a secure manner and attempt to use that first before requesting the user to log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;google-sheets-api&quot;&gt;Google Sheets API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next came the access of the actual Google Sheet. Which first required me to enable the Google Sheet API for the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs I have provided the program. After that I then needed to add another scope. Which is achieved (as need above in a comment) by appending the correct Scope URL. Which is my case is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly&lt;/code&gt; which provides read only access to the Signed in User’s Google Sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there the REST API is quite &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; with all the requests I’m interested in being &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests making it even simpler by not requiring formatted payloads. I just needed to create the needed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;structs&lt;/code&gt; that would allow me to interact with the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sqlite-database&quot;&gt;SQLite Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there I had the ability to pull data. I had to determine how to store it in the SQLite database file. Now instead of implementing SQLite 3 myself I did use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3&quot;&gt;an external library&lt;/a&gt; but given the complexity, and the fact I wanted to do this in a month, it was the best option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now most of the sheet’s within my Google Sheet have 6 Columns. Those being Date, Balance, Debit, Credit, Title, and Notes. With there being 9 different sheets that I wanted to pull down. So what I created two basic tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trans_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;TEXT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FOREIGN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;REFERENCES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One two store sheet names (and eventually other data about that particular sheet but hey that’s a future project) and another to store the actual transactions. Where instead of having three columns containing data on the transaction I have one. Being the change in the account. From there (and by making the assumption all accounts start at 0) I can then find the balance. And if I want to create a table similar to my old sheets I can use the following SQL command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trans_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;$%.2f&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ROUND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; 
                            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
                          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trans&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; 
                          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; 
                            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trans_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trans_id&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CASE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;THEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;$%.2f&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;ELSE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;debit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CASE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;THEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;$%.2f&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;ELSE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trans&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-loading&quot;&gt;Data Loading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there came the need to load which was done with some simple &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statements and some logic that handled determine if the rows in the sheet where to be negative or positive. Which wasn’t to bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-golang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sheetName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;A1:F&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;transFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetAccountTransactionCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accountID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;transFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toWrite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[][]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toWrite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toWrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Writing %d rows from %s to %d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toWrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sheetName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accountID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WriteTransaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accountID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toWrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;%s up to date with %d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sheetName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accountID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function this was contained in also allowed me to preform the insertions only when there are more rows in the Sheet than corresponding rows within the DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-why&quot;&gt;But Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the why I did this. There are two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve been wanting to make a program that allows me to preform “better” analysis on the data within this Google sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m currently using Gotify within my Proxmox Instance. And by default it does not have a way to integrate with Discord Webhooks. And given it’s written in Go and I can expand it using plugins. My next project is to then add that functionality. Which I hope to post about next month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s really it. Eventually I plan on expanding this. Maybe even creating an interface for it so it can present graphs. But until then it has provided me a place to muck around with Go before having to interact with with the Gotify plugin system. And I must say. I might start using Go for more of my prototyping than Javascript or Python. I like how it feels compared to them. Especially with the fact it feels more like C which I always enjoyed writing. It just takes quite a bit of work to get something beyond basic functionality working. With Go providing a rather impressive standard library.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-posts" /><category term="golang" /><category term="budget-app" /><summary type="html">Well.

&lt;p&gt;Well. It’s now been 2024 for a couple weeks now. But hey better late than never to make some resolutions. So let’s end this post with a couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-year-resolutions&quot;&gt;Last Year Resolutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all let’s make an assessment of last year’s resolutions. Those being the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make progress and or complete at least 3 of my personal projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make more regular posts here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a job lined up for after Graduation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socialize more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple list that seemed achievable for the most part. Unfortunately though they didn’t all stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;heavy_check_mark-completionprogress-on-projects&quot;&gt;:heavy_check_mark: Completion/Progress on projects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m going to be honest. I originally went in to this with the plan to finish my project management project first. And then work on a couple other projects. In reality I only “shelved” a project. That being to create a “map” of what Wikipedia article is related to each other. Which is slightly mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;/weekly-posts/d3/2023/04/15/D3-exploration.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. And that was only done because it sounded like an interested project that I could use for a class project where I could effectively scale the amount of data I saved to a database, which was a concern due to the project having a requirement of using “a reasonably sized data set”. And in this point I’ve shelved farther development on it due to the SHEAR number of connections I found doing it in that limited sense. As a result I concluded while it would be interesting in the future. I do not have the time to pursue that now. That and there are a couple academic papers on it I found. So that was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for completing or shelfing other projects. I, rather effectively, used the fact I hadn’t finished my management project to stall the starting or even finishing of other projects. Which is just a problem I have of starting and then forgetting about projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can actually still mark this resolution as a success. I just have to stretch my original intention. Which was that I was going to complete projects on my list at that time. If I count other projects I did end up completing a couple more. Like a making a Discord bot and setting up a Proxmox server. So taking that into account, success on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x-more-regular-posts&quot;&gt;:x: More Regular Posts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of my resolutions though was to make one regular posts. With the original resolution being and I quote. “Once every two weeks? I really need to determine some sort of schedule.” Which become the original plan. Which then changed in May to be once a month on the 15th or 16th of each month. But given that between then and now I’ve only made a grand total of 2 other posts. I think that plan fell through hard. So I’m going to count this one as a complete miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wavy_dash-lining-up-a-job&quot;&gt;:wavy_dash: Lining up a Job&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to honestly count this as an almost. Cause I did get a job within less than a month of graduating. And that did take some effort (and maybe a little bit of luck). But hey I’m happy in my current position. And am still there which is great. Below being a table of what it took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Count&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Applications&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;74&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Rejections&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Stopped Pursing for Personal Reasons&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ghosts&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Interviews (Some Multiple)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Accepted Offer&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wavy_dash-socializing&quot;&gt;:wavy_dash: Socializing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of hard to quantify it but I have been getting out a little more. But I could still improve it. I’m not going to dig any farther into it than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-resolutions&quot;&gt;New Resolutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So effectively I completed 2/4 of my resolutions if we want to consider half successes as 0.5. Now what about 2024. Well we’re going to learn a bit from the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a better method of managing projects and actually use it.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This NEEDS done. Something other than Github Projects cause that doesn’t work as well as I would hope.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make progress or complete 3 projects
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Repeat of last year but hey. It’s something I still want to do. And I could do better.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monthly Posts
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Again a repeat of last year. But I think it’s more obtainable than the every two weeks. I just need to take the time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be more productive.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is rather generic. But most resolutions are. I just have felt my ambition slipping recently for a couple reasons and I need to turn that around.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-management&quot;&gt;Project Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on to something else. And that’s how I’m going to achieve some of these resolutions. And that’s deciding what I’m going to use for project management. So that began a bit of a search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desired-qualitiesfeatures&quot;&gt;Desired Qualities/Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first off. My requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off is that it needs to be free and open source. That mostly being because I don’t want to worry about paying for it at the moment. That may change in the future but for now that’s how I’m going to roll. Next is a preference I didn’t think I’d have originally but found I find of need. And that is that it be web based. Mostly being so I don’t have to access my notes and projects from a specific computer. Which leads me into the other requirement being that I want it to be self hosted on my Proxmox instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-found&quot;&gt;What I Found&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in my search I found the following options. Not all of which though that fit my requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Selection&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Solution&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;My Requirements&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Features&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Reason For Not Selecting&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openproject.org/&quot;&gt;Open Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type:none;margin: 0; padding: 0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot; onclick=&quot;return false&quot; /&gt; Open Source&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot; onclick=&quot;return false&quot; /&gt; Free&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot; onclick=&quot;return false&quot; /&gt; Web App&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot; onclick=&quot;return false&quot; /&gt; Self Hosted&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Project Portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Project Planning&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Task Management&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Time Tracking&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Team Collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Roadmaps&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Workflows&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;More features that I need for personal use.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plane.so/&quot;&gt;Plane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type:none;margin: 0; padding: 0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot; onclick=&quot;return false&quot; /&gt; Open Source&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m no one to talk about what systems are the best. But when I went into this I wanted something where I could take my notes, create projects, and track tasks within those projects. And at this point in time. Vikunja seems to fit the bill at least when it comes to the task of projects and tasks. Unfortunately it doesn’t explicitly support notes like I want. But for how well it works for me at the moment I’m going to see how well it works. If anything I’m going to use it for a year. That’s the goal. If I can successfully use it then that first resolution is done. Hopefully assisting me with the others. We’ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

Mostly so I can host some things for myself and to just experiment. So using some hardware I have sitting around I finally took the time to do this in back in June. (Clearly I have had a bit of time to muck around.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a recent college graduate. I don’t like spending a lot of money. (At least that’s my relationship with money.) So nearly all the hardware I’m using for this have been given to me either because it was “broken” or old and unneeded. Which makes it a rather eclectic collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hardware-list&quot;&gt;Hardware List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dell Inspiron 3656
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;AMD A10-8700P CPU&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;12 Gigs of RAM (8+4)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1TB Western Digital HHD&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter (Currently unused)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;DVD Drive (Currently unused)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 Router&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;USB Devices
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Linksys WUSB54GC Wifi Adapter&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;USB to SATA/IDE adapter (JM20337)
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Connected to ASUS Blueray Drive&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-machine&quot;&gt;The Machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for hardware I started with a Dell Inspiron 3656 that I had received due to it being “broken” quite a few years ago. It turned out the issue was not with hardware but with a corrupted operating system. Originally equipped with AMD A10-8700P CPU, an AMD Radeon R9 360 GPU, and a Wifi Card among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though by the time I got around to using it for Proxmox the GPU and the original hard drive had already been harvested and used else where. So I grabbed a 1TB Western Digital hard drive that I had kicking around and I installed Proxmox. I also ended up adding around 4 gigabytes of RAM bringing it up to 12 gigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately though I do not have the ability to give myself a wired connection to my Proxmox server which is required for it’s operation. (There is a way to use Wifi but it’s described as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/proxmox-over-wifi-wlan.123805/&quot;&gt;“spotty workaround.”&lt;/a&gt;). But I had a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;networking-solution&quot;&gt;Networking solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been a college student for the last couple years living in a dorm I have myself a travel router (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt300n-v2/&quot;&gt;GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2&lt;/a&gt;). The reason I had this was mostly because I didn’t want to have to deal with connecting multiple devices to the school’s network which sometimes required a MAC address registration that could expire. That and I wanted to have most of my devices to be wired when I was in my dorm. So I used that router in combination with an 8 port switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This though doesn’t explain how this solves the issue of not being able to wire my Proxmox server. A feature of this travel router is that is can connect to a Wifi network and use that as the WAN network. Using this functionality I then simply hooked my Proxmox box into the LAN port of my travel router. That though doesn’t solve all of my issues which I’ll go into later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usb-devices&quot;&gt;USB Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that I have a couple USB devices that are important to my current setup. A USB Wifi Adapter that I pass through to one VM and a USB to Sata adapter that I use to connect a Blueray drive that is eventually passed to another VM. Both of which I’ll explain later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vms-and-services&quot;&gt;VMs and Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the power of this rather inexpensive hardware I have for the last couple months I have been running a couple VMs and Service. As it stands at the writing of this article I have 3 Ubuntu VMs running and 2 LXC containers (both are Debian based).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are a couple notes on what I have running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LXC (&lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;inu&lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ontainers&lt;/a&gt; built into Proxmox)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.turnkeylinux.org/fileserver&quot;&gt;TurnKey File Server&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Used as my NAS not &lt;a href=&quot;https://unraid.net/&quot;&gt;Unraid&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truenas.com/&quot;&gt;TrueNAS&lt;/a&gt; but it works for my use case for now.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.turnkeylinux.org/mediaserver&quot;&gt;TurnKey Media Server&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Provides some of the same functionality as the File Server. But I used it for &lt;a href=&quot;https://jellyfin.org/&quot;&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt;. With all my media being stored on the File Server.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VMs
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;General VM
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 22.04 VM for tinkering&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pi.Alert VM
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 22.04 VM that runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pucherot/Pi.Alert&quot;&gt;Pi.Alert&lt;/a&gt; which I use on the main home network.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Docker VM
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 22.04 VM that I use to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker containers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Containers
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dashy.to/&quot;&gt;Dashy&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Homepage/Dashboard for all of my services I’m running.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filestash.app/&quot;&gt;FileStash&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Application that I use to provide a better web interface for my File Server.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gotify.net/&quot;&gt;Gotify&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Notification Server that I set up to receive notifications from Proxmox.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma&quot;&gt;Uptime Kuma&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Uptime Tracker I use for my Services. Realistically overkill but it’s fun to muck with.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nginxproxymanager.com/&quot;&gt;NGINX Proxy Manager&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Currently I use this effectively as DNS. Very useful for mapping services running in docker rather than having each container having open ports.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Windows VM
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;There are times you just need a windows VM to test something.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Also used to backup DVDs and Bluerays for use in Jellyfin using the Blueray drive passed through.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weird-network-connectivity&quot;&gt;Weird Network Connectivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now. Remember how I mentioned that Proxmox is wired through a travel router. Well this creates a little issue. Mostly because I didn’t want to turn the router’s pass through mode on. And that is the fact that it’s a different network entirely compared to my home network. Which requires me to port forward anything out of that network that I want to be accessible to my home network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fine and it works for most applications. Heck I can even still ping things on my home network from the Proxmox network due to the different subnets. But what this didn’t work for was Pi.Alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pialert-and-my-use-case&quot;&gt;Pi.Alert and My Use Case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Pi.Alert functions is it makes use of arp-scan to scan the network. And while doing so it retrieves the current IP and MAC address of each device on the network. It preforms this scan periodically at 5 and 15 minute intervals logging what devices are currently responding. What I wanted this for was more out of curiosity cause I’ve noticed that my phone will occasionally drop off Wifi and this provides me a record of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way. The issue I was running into was the fact that because my VMs are on a separate networks (labeled subnets in the above diagram) using Arp-Scan can not scan the devices on the other network unless it has an network device attached to it. Which brought about the use a USB Wifi Adapter to provide the VM a network connection outside of the network device Proxmox provides it. And even better I had to remove that because if I attempted to SSH into it chaos ensured because it would attempt to send responses to my SSH client from the Wifi connection rather than the Proxmox connection. Resulting in the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which kind of annoys me. But it works after I found a working USB Wifi adapter. Because of course it wasn’t simple. The first one I attempted to use died right after I got everything configed. And the current adapter has some strange behavior where it will occationally just disconnect from the VM and Proxmox entirely and act as if it’s loss power. But either way it’s fun and now I get nice graphs of my phone’s connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in time that’s all I’ve really used my Proxmox Server for. I do now host a Discord Bot as well. But that’s limited to two Discord Servers at this point with no plans of expansion. So far it’s been fun. But I would not recommend the network setup I have. Get a proper wired connection. Or at least use a passthrough mode. We’ll see what else I do in the future. I have some Ideas. But what becomes of them is not a given.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-posts" /><category term="ramblings" /><category term="proxmox" /><summary type="html">Something I have been planning to do for a while has been to muck around with Proxmox.

But hey. That’s what happens when I get a job that effectively takes 12 hours out of my day when I go to the office. But oh well. That’s just fine and I’m happy with the job. Either way. Enough work. Time for the fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-site-has-been-updated&quot;&gt;The Site Has been Updated!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m officially graduated I (and now have gainful employment). I’ve decided that I don’t really need a list of the classes I’ve taken on the homepage so that has now been moved to the About page. Sure does make the home page feel cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s on the only thing new about the site. After nearly 2 years and 18 posts I’ve finally become annoyed enough of using a Bash script to publish this things that I’ve automated the process using Github Actions. Previously I would run a Bash script that would build a copy of the site. Then pull the public repository and copy the new site over to the repository before pushing it back up. Which would then trigger the Github action on that repository for Github pages. Now this worked. But It wasn’t the best and was kind of annoying. Especially because it required a specific folder structure. Which while works fine now would not if I was to ever edit the site on anything but my laptop. Now when ever I want to push an update to the live site I simply need to push a git tag up to my private remote repository which will then preform all the building and copying over of the static files to the public repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not even that complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;/assets/config-files/github-action-post-site.yml&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;560rem&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less it does the same exact thing my bash script did. Except within a Github worker using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/checkout&quot;&gt;Github’s actions/checkout action&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cpina/github-action-push-to-another-repository&quot;&gt;another action build by cpina called push-to-another-repository-deploy&lt;/a&gt;. Which does exactly what it says on the tin. Just instead of me manually triggering it using a bash script. It automatically fires when a new git tag is pushed on to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said simple. But if someone (I wouldn’t know who seems like a niche issue) wants to use this the config file can be &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/config-files/github-action-post-site.yml&quot;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;. Just click the link and hit &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CTRL-S&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proxmox-virtualization-for-the-win&quot;&gt;Proxmox Virtualization For the Win.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I haven’t been the best at documenting it (so many missed opportunities for posts) I have been mucking around with Proxmox which has been something I have wanted to do for a while. And using the power of a &lt;strong&gt;MIGHTY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AMD A10-8700P Radeon R6, 10 Compute Cores 4C+6G&lt;/code&gt;. Now with that little bit of sarcasm out of the way it has been rather nice. Currently I’m just running a couple Linux Containers for a simple file server and Jellyfin as well as a couple VMs. One of them is even a Windows VM that has a grand total of 4 gigs of ram. :laughing: I honestly am surprised how well that runs. But that VM itself is off most of the time. Either way. That will be something to write about in another post. Specifically when things are a little more concrete in what’s running. Then again. We’ll see when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-to-do-for-this-month&quot;&gt;So what to do for this month.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. I got a whole 29 days left of this year and a couple things I still need to get done. By my own list I still have posts from June until December to do. Which while I can’t time travel I can still come up with a quick and interesting project for them. And hey this post itself knocks me down to 6 posts left for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for the first time ever I’m participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https://adventofcode.com/&quot;&gt;Advent of Code.&lt;/a&gt; Which is an advent calendar of programming puzzles. And while I might not be the fastest one to get them done (I’m not staying up til midnight to be first) it’s nice to have some “simple” puzzles to work on. This year I’m doing it in Javascript. But maybe I’ll do it in another language next year. Or maybe I’ll even do the previous year’s calendars. We’ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will likely write my self up an assessment kind of what I did last year. But the year ain’t over yet so that will have to wait. Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="weekly-posts" /><category term="ramblings" /><summary type="html">Well so much for making monthly posts like I had planned.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve officially graduated with a degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. With a grand total of 130 credit hours completed and finishing with a GPA of 3.88 with Distinction. One of at least five in my department that achieved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;classes-completed&quot;&gt;Classes Completed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final semester included 4 classes. One of which being my senior capstone project. As well as the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;advance-database-systems&quot;&gt;Advance Database Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance Databases Systems if anything was interesting. With the professor going over quite a few things from NoSQL databases to data warehousing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;semester-project&quot;&gt;Semester Project&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the thing I’m probably going to remember the most is the semester project. Which I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;/weekly-posts/d3/2023/04/15/D3-exploration.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;. By the end we ended up indexing over 60,000 different Wikipedia articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are quite a few things that I think we’d do differently in the future. Such as looking into using a Graph based database like Neo4j due to the heavy use of relations we ended up making in our MongoDB database. Along with looking into preforming more actual analysis of the data we gathered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;computer-security&quot;&gt;Computer Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was very informative with us preforming “real world” exploits on systems. Though most of the exploits were dated. This class definitely provided the knowledge we needed in order to be aware of how our software could be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;numerical-analysis&quot;&gt;Numerical Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Numerical Analysis this was another very interesting class. With the completion of it being all that was left for in order to get my Math Minor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also gave some insight to analysis which while I might not directly make use of in the future I feel that I am better for having taken the course than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;senior-capstone-completed&quot;&gt;Senior Capstone COMPLETED!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’ve finally completed our Senior Capstone and from what we could gather our sponsor was pleased with the progress we made. And even plans to use it in the future. Though I may have been a little quick to admit that I’m not 100% confident in the security of the project at this point in time. We did take the precautions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though due to the documents we signed relating with this project I’ll not be doing a writeup on the project as I have with previous class projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall though I’m happy with how I finished. I might not have gotten a 4.0 and I might have been able to get a higher GPA. But where I ended and the connections I’ve made are nothing to scoff at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I need to make adjustments to the expectations of my New Years Resolutions though. As of now while I am interviewing with places I do not have full time employment. Which given the current situation is to be expected from what I can gather. But then again what do I know? This is just the beginning of my career and I don’t exactly have the most experience in this front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another adjustment is going to be how often I most. Initially I wanted to do weekly or biweekly posts. But as of now I’m thinking monthly posts are going to be more reasonable. So the new goal is that. With the intention being that they be dated for the 15th or 16th of each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way. Time to get to work. The perfect job isn’t going to land in my lap without some effort and searching. The journey is long and it’s just now beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
