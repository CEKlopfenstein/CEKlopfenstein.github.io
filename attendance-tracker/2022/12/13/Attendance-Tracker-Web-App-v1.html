    <p>It’s been a minute since I posted on here. But here is something I have been working
on for a few months off and on that is related to the Attendance Tracker App.</p>

<p>More or less what I’ve been doing is slowly rebuilding the app using React.js. Giving
myself a project I can work on while learning React.js that is complex enough to be
considered somewhat of a challenge. While also being simple enough that I can use it
as a learning experience. That and in the future if we wanted to make this app multi-platform
it would be much simpler to do so using React and React Native rather than having 
vastly different code bases for the different platforms. Especially sense we don’t
absolutely need the performance afforded to us by being completely native.</p>

<p>That being said version 1 can be found <a href="/assets/web-app-attendance/v1/">By following the link here.</a>
Feel free to take a look around. But please do not try to use it as a fully functioning app.
Everything that would be stored in a database is currently being stored in LocalStorage.
Which I have a low confidence in long term but allows for the thing to be functional for
demonstration purposes.</p>

<p>There are also features like the ability to mark a student as not present and other 
operations like that. But the original Android app didn’t have that so I don’t feel
exceptionally bad about this one not having it either. This web app also doesn’t
have the ability to send emails due to that then requiring a proper infrastructure.
Which I am currently not willing to pay for just a demo.</p>
