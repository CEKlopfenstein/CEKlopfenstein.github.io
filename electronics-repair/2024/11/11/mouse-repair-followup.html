    <p>Well, here I am again. I had originally planned on posting about my 3D printers as my next post. But that has changed.</p>

<p>Now you get a short post following up on the repair I posted about <a href="/electronics-repair/2022/04/17/mouse-repair.html">April 17th of 2022</a> where I repaired my Naga Trinity’s left click.</p>

<h2 id="the-follow-up">The Follow Up</h2>
<p>Well. After around 2 years the switch once again began failing in the same darn way. Where it would double-click. Likely due to corrosion within the switch from slight arcing. Or at least that’s my best guess. And beyond my best judgment, because I had completely forgotten how difficult it was to remove the switch. I decided I needed to repair it again. With the same iron that was a poor choice last time because the battery on my new one wasn’t charged.</p>

<p>The repair at this point does appear to be a success in terms of restoring functionality once again. The whole job took about 75 minutes this time compared to the 2 hours of soldering I fought through last time. This time it was 10 minutes of me trying to find the screws to realize I had two sets of skids on the mouse. And another hour of struggling to desolder the switch again. Once again destructively removing it.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p>But hey. She’s once again fixed. This time with no extra materials needing to be purchased. I just used what I had from last time. But this experience CONCRETELY confirms the fact I need a better iron for this kind of thing. I also need to make sure to put the kittens away next time so they don’t decide that the screws on my work mat are toys. Because I am now down a screw. But I’m “fine” with that since it’s my mouse. Not like I plan on selling it later.</p>

<p>It also appears that since the last time I did this Razer appears to have replaced the Naga Trinity with the Naga Pro V2. So I might get myself one of those if this sucker crokes again. First I’m going to wait for the 2-year mark to hit for its release to see if it suffers the same problem.</p>

<p>Either way. HOPEFULLY the next post is about my printers. That’s the plan atleast.</p>
